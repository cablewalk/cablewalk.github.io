Timetable / Scheduling 앱을 만드려고 하면 뭐가 필요할지 고민하다가 글로 적어야 할 것 같아 끄적이는 공간.

data is expressed as arrays? Database table?

or classes?

ex. student is expressed as a class and a Student instance could have the metadata of name, classes enrolled, etc.

a "subject" could also be expressed as a class and a Subject instance could have the metadata of subject name, duration, classroom number, etc.

now how do we let python know about 'constraints'? such as a professor can only teach one subject at a time, a classroom can only hold one subject at a time, a student can only be in one classroom at a time, etc.?

**Constraint programming**
